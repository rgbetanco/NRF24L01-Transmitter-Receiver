# NRF24L01-Transmitter-Receiver
A transmitter and receiver for the NRF24L01+

The circuit and connectino to the avr chip are identical for the transmitter and receiver

Although in the picture pins one and two has a 4.7uF capacitor, I could not really see the advantage of that capacitor in the transmition or reception of the information.

The reception is not 100% garantee so the signal need to be sent a couple of times.
